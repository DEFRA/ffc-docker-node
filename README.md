# FFC docker parent

This repository contains the docker files that build parent container images for FFC projects to extend. Each sub-folder contains the source files required to build a single image. There is also an examples folder that contains example Dockerfiles for various services. These can be used to build a Dockerfile for your service which uses the parent images created by this project.

## Example files

`Dockerfile.web` - This is an example web project, that requires a build step to create some static files that are used by the web front end.

`Dockerfile.service` - This is an example project that doesn't expose any external ports (a message based service). There is also no build step in this dockerfile.
